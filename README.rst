*OSPFM* stands for *Open Source online Personal Finance Management*.

This  project is  in early  stage of  development, in  fact nothing  exists yet
(03.26.2012).  OSPFM will be the foundations  for a Software-as-a-Service tool,
whose name is still undecided.

*OSPFM* official website is http://tiramiseb.github.com/ospfm.

Documentation as HTML
=====================

To convert  all documentation  to HTML,  you need the  docutils tool  (from the
python-docutils  package  in some  Linux  distributions).  Simply  execute  the
``docs-to-html.sh`` script in the project's root directory. Every ``.rst`` file
will then have a HTML equivalent.

When you read them online on the GitHub website,  these files are automatically
converted.

Manifesto
=========

To  understand  the motivation  behind  OSPFM,  please  read  the  manifesto in
``MANIFESTO.rst``.

What exactly is OSPFM ?
-----------------------

OSPFM is a set of Django applications.
The AGPL license applies to these Django applications.

The "ospfm" Django project,  distributed under the AGPL license too, is only an
example  and may or may not  be used to  serve data  generated by  OSPFM Django
applications.  Its  goal  is  mainly  to  give  developers  an  easy-to-install
environment when working on OSPFM Django applications.

It means  that if  a  website  uses  OSPFM  Django  applications,  there is  no
obligation to distribute  any other part of the  website under the terms of the
AGPL: distribution of other parts is up to the website's owner.
