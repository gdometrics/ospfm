*OSPFM* stands for *Open Source online Personal Finance Management*.

This project is in early stage of development, in fact nothing exists yet
(03.26.2012). OSPFM will be the foundations for a Software-as-a-Service tool,
whose name is still undecided.

*OSPFM* official website is http://tiramiseb.github.com/ospfm.

Documentation as HTML
=====================

To convert all documentation to HTML, you need the docutils tool (from the
python-docutils package in some Linux distributions). Simply execute the
``docs-to-html.sh`` script in the project's root directory. Every ``.rst`` file
will then have a HTML equivalent.

When you read them online on the GitHub website, these files are automatically
converted.

Manifesto
=========

To understand the motivation behind OSPFM, please read the manifesto in
``MANIFESTO.rst``.
