OSPFM manifesto
===============

(written before any line of code and before any technical decision)

I, as Omoma’s and  OSPFM’s creator,  first wanted a tool making life easier for
me and my wife. The main feature we needed was the ability to mark an operation
as “made for someone else”,  in order to stop caring about loans in our family.
It appeared that the best way to do that is with a webapp. I have tried to make
something usable on  multiple computers and servers,  but rapidly realized that
was too complicated, both for developers and users.

That’s why, after months of thinking, I have decided to make a SaaS offer, with
two simple plans:

* a free plan, offering basic features (a few accounts, categories...)
* a paying plan  (not too expensive though),  with advanced  features (reports,
  recurring operations, previsions...)

Despite being a SaaS application,  **the software running  this service, OSPFM,
would still be Open Source**,  because I believe  in Open Source  principles. I
want OSPFM to be  distributed  under the GNU AGPL.  Nothing would forbid you to
install your own instance of the software,  and all improvements you make would
be published under the AGPL license.

However, I think  installing OSPFM  on multiple servers  would block one of its
main advantages:  sharing expenses with  people all  over the world.  People on
different servers would not  be able to share their operations.  It is why I am
willing  to  give  free  "paying plan" accounts  to people  who  help on  OSPFM
(developers, translators, etc).

Oh, and I don’t want to make it  easy for other companies to take my (hopefully
our) work and sell it as-is. That is why:

* I’m not  planning  to make  extensive  documentation,  especially  on OSPFM’s
  installation  (but it would  not be really  different  from some  other great
  Open Source apps)
* The subscription and billing app would not be Open Source
* Graphic creations (icons etc) would not be  Open Source in order to give this
  service a unique look&feel

I hope you  will understand the  choices I have made,  I hope you will use this
service and maybe  contribute to OSPFM,  I hope this service  would allow me to
live a simple  life with my family,  I hope this will make  the world better by
allowing people to spend less and save more.
